# Square-Cube-Roots
Write a C Language Program that will prompt for and read in a positive integer.  Use a doâ€¦while loop to continuing reading until a positive integer is entered.  Your program will then compute to three decimal places the square root and the cube root for each positive integer from 1 up to and including the entered value.  Use a for loop to perform the calculations and display a table on the screen showing each integer and its square root value and cube root value.  The table should have an appropriate heading for each of the three columns (value, square root, and cube root).  The table data should be the numbers only, properly formatted so that the columns align down the screen.
